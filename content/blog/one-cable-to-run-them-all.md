My switch to 100% work from home left me scrambling to find a setup that allowed me to work and play from the same desk. My desk is currently sporting a 120hz Dell 34" ultrawide along with a 144hz Dell 27" all powered with a beefy 3090.

I needed something that allowed me to hook up my monitors and ***all*** my peripherals to my work issued MacBook Pro during the day and gaming PC during the evening. The answer? A Thunderbolt PCI-E card, a CalDigit TS3+, and Apple's 130 dollar Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable.

## **KVM? Nope.**

I started my search looking for a KVM and saw several potential pain points. I needed wires going from my laptop to the KVM and my PC to the KVM — that meant doubling the amount of wires. No thanks.

The g-sync support seemed to be hit or miss depending on switch. They also were either too bulky or lacked the amount of USB ports I required.

## **Thunderbolt? Yep.**

I became obsessed with the idea of having *one* cable I can connect to my laptop during work hours then unplug and connect to my PC for my gaming needs. I would only have to swap around one cable!

The first problem is the lack of Thunderbolt 3 connectivity for my PC. The only solution for my Asus ROG Maximus XII Hero motherboard was purchasing an Thunderbolt 3 PCI-E expansion card. This card supports up to two monitors. If you have more, you need a motherboard with built in TB ports or another solution.

The second problem was finding the right hub to support my high refresh rate DisplayPort monitors. After reading through many reviews, I settled on the CalDigit TS3 Plus for the sheer amount of connectivity and promising DisplayPort support. Because it only has 1 DisplayPort input, I also purchased a CalDigit's DisplayPort to USB-C to connect my second monitor.

The third and final problem was finding the right cable. I needed a couple things: DisplayPort support, USB 3.1 speeds, and a long cable. The Apple Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable fit that bill (it’s actually the *only* cable to support 3.1 and DisplayPort on the market as of this writing).

## **Pure bliss (almost)**

I’ve used this setup for over six months and have been switching between my work laptop and gaming rig daily. G-sync works, Ubuntu works, 144hz+ refresh rate on both monitors works — everything just works and I can’t be happier.

But I do run to problems on occasion when my devices go to sleep. Sometimes the display does not come back on and I need to unplug and replug the Thunderbolt cable. Not a big deal.

Another issue is dual booting. When the GRUB menu appears, my keyboard does not work so I cannot choose which OS to boot into. I temporarily plug in another keyboard to my machine to select an OS — not a deal breaker for me since I boot into windows 90% of the time.
