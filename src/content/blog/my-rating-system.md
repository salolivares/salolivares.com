Did I say objective? I meant _highly_ subjective. For my own sanity I needed a consistent way
to rate things (restaurants, tv shows, movies, etc.) and ensure each number had a specific meaning.
So I turned to Reddit and was unsurprisingly met with a [plethora of rating systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterboxd/comments/tvgsdl/whats_your_starrating_system/). I took this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Letterboxd/comments/tvgsdl/whats_your_starrating_system/i39bin4/) and adapted it to my needs.

## The rating scale

- **10** (_5 stars_) - All time favorites. Perfect. Flawless. Impossibly amazing.
- **9** (_4.5 stars_) - One of the best. Near flawless.
- **8** (_4 stars_) - So great, always recommended. The positive outweigh the flaws.
- **7** (_3.5 stars_) - I enjoyed it. My most common rating.
- **6** (_3 stars_) - Enjoyable, but with flaws. Nothing special.
- **5** (_2.5 stars_) - Did not enjoy, but had some moments. Neither disliked or liked it.
- **4** (_2 stars_) - Bad, but there are one or two redeeming qualities
- **3** (_1.5 stars_) - As bad as you can get, but may be something there
- **2** (_1 stars_) - Nothing redeemable
- **1** (_0.5 stars_) - I HATE IT, IT MAKES ME ANGRY

I just wanted to document my rating system somewhere since I was constantly forgetting my own scale. It's most definitely not perfect, and I'll be updating it along the way!
